# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AdReply extension needs to track which ad variations have been used in specific Facebook groups to prevent repetitive advertising within 24-hour periods. This system will ensure natural, non-spammy advertising by rotating through different ad variations and excluding recently used ones from recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a marketer, I want the system to track which ad variations I've used in each Facebook group, so that I don't repeat the same ads too frequently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an ad variation to use it, THE AdReply_System SHALL record the usage event with timestamp and group information
2. THE AdReply_System SHALL store the ad variation ID, Facebook group ID, and usage timestamp in local storage
3. THE AdReply_System SHALL maintain separate usage tracking for each Facebook group
4. THE AdReply_System SHALL persist usage data across browser sessions and extension restarts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Facebook group advertiser, I want used ad variations to be excluded from recommendations for 24 hours, so that I maintain variety in my advertising approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating ad recommendations, THE AdReply_System SHALL check usage history for the current Facebook group
2. THE AdReply_System SHALL exclude ad variations used within the last 24 hours in the same group
3. THE AdReply_System SHALL calculate the 24-hour exclusion period from the original usage timestamp
4. WHERE all variations of a template have been used recently, THE AdReply_System SHALL allow the oldest used variation to be recommended again

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with multiple ad templates, I want the system to rotate to the next appropriate ad with matching keywords, so that I always have relevant recommendations available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AdReply_System SHALL prioritize unused ad variations that match the post keywords
2. WHEN filtering out recently used variations, THE AdReply_System SHALL maintain keyword relevance scoring
3. THE AdReply_System SHALL rotate through available variations in order of relevance score
4. WHERE no unused variations match the keywords, THE AdReply_System SHALL recommend the oldest used variation with matching keywords

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want usage tracking data to be stored locally and automatically cleaned up, so that my advertising patterns remain private and storage doesn't grow indefinitely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AdReply_System SHALL store all usage tracking data in browser local storage only
2. THE AdReply_System SHALL automatically remove usage records older than 30 days
3. THE AdReply_System SHALL provide manual cleanup options for usage history
