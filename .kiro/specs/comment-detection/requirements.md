# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AdReply extension currently recommends ads for posts that the user has already commented on. This creates a poor user experience as users receive duplicate recommendations for posts they've already engaged with. The system needs to detect existing user comments and skip ad recommendations for posts where the user has already participated.

## Glossary

- **AdReply Extension**: The browser extension that analyzes Facebook posts and recommends relevant ads
- **User Comment**: A comment posted by the current Facebook user on a post
- **Post Analysis**: The process of extracting post content and generating ad recommendations
- **Comment Detection**: The process of identifying if the current user has already commented on a post
- **Facebook User Profile**: The current logged-in Facebook user's profile information

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to skip posts I've already commented on, so that I don't receive duplicate ad recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension analyzes a post, THE AdReply Extension SHALL check for existing user comments before generating recommendations
2. IF the current user has already commented on the post, THEN THE AdReply Extension SHALL skip ad recommendation generation
3. THE AdReply Extension SHALL display a message indicating the post was skipped due to existing engagement
4. THE AdReply Extension SHALL log the skip action for debugging purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to accurately identify my comments, so that only my comments (not others') prevent recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AdReply Extension SHALL identify the current Facebook user's profile information
2. THE AdReply Extension SHALL compare comment authors against the current user's profile
3. WHEN checking for existing comments, THE AdReply Extension SHALL only consider comments authored by the current user
4. THE AdReply Extension SHALL handle cases where user profile information is not immediately available

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to work reliably across different Facebook interfaces, so that comment detection works in feeds, overlays, and group posts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AdReply Extension SHALL detect user comments in the main Facebook feed
2. THE AdReply Extension SHALL detect user comments in Facebook group posts
3. THE AdReply Extension SHALL detect user comments in post overlay/modal views
4. THE AdReply Extension SHALL handle Facebook's dynamic content loading for comment detection
